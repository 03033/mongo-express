mongo-express
=============

Web-based MongoDB admin interface written with Node.js and express


Features
--------

Current features:

* Connect to multiple databases
* Connect and authenticate to individual databases
* Authenticate as admin to view all databases
* Database blacklist/whitelist
* View/add/rename/delete collections
* View/add/update/delete documents
* Use BSON data types in documents

Planned features:

* Support for replica set connections
* Web-based command-line interface
* Site authentication
* REST interface


Limitations
-----------

* Documents must have document._id property to be edited
* No GridFS support (might become a planned feature)
* BSON data types are not all working correctly (Do not use mongo-express for editing complex docs for now!)

Usage
-----

**To install:**

    npm install mongo-express

Or if you want to install a global copy:

    npm install -g mongo-express

**To configure:**

Copy `config.default.js` into a new file called `config.js`.

Fill in your MongoDB connection details, and any other options you want to change.

**To run:**

    node app

**To use:**

Visit `http://localhost:8081` or whatever URL/port you entered into your config.


BSON Data Types
---------------

Not all BSON data types are working correctly. This means that mongo-express cannot display or add these data types.

The currently working data types:

* Native Javascript types: strings, numbers, floats, lists, booleans, null, etc.
* ObjectID: can also use ObjectId
* ISODate
* Long/Double: use native Javascript numbers
* DBRef/Dbref: Use as `DBRef("collection", "object ID", "database")`

---

**Native Javascript Types**

Strings, numbers, lists, booleans, null, etc.

All numbers in Javascript are 64-bit floating points.

**ObjectID/ObjectId**

    ObjectID()

Creates a new Object ID type.

    ObjectID("id")

Use Object ID with the given 24-digit hexadecimal string.

**ISODate**

    ISODate()

Creates a new ISODate object with current time.

`new Date()` can also be used (note the `new` keyword there).

    ISODate("timestamp")

Uses ISODate object with the given timestamp.

**DBRef/Dbref**

    DBRef("collection", "object ID")

    DBRef("collection", "object ID", "database")

Object ID is the ID string, not the ObjectID type.

The database value is optional.

**Timestamp**

    Timestamp()

Creates a new Timestamp object with a value of 0.

    Timestamp(time, ordinal)

Use like `Timestamp(new Date(), 0)`.

See [http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Timestamp+data+type](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Timestamp+data+type) for more info about the Timestamp data type.

---

Not tested (probably broken):

* Timestamp
* Binary/BinData
* Code
* Symbol
* MinKey
* MaxKey

Here is an example of a document with BSON data types in mongo-express:

    {
      "_id": ObjectID(), // or ObjectId()
      "dates": {
        "date": ISODate("2012-05-14T16:20:09.314Z"),
        "new_date": ISODate()
      },
      "bool": true,
      "string": "hello world!",
      "list of numbers": [
        123,
        111e+87,
        4.4,
        -12345.765
      ],
      "reference": DBRef("collection", "4fb1299686a989240b000001"),
      "ts": Timestamp(new Date(), 1)
    }
